# Hi there 👋, I'm Aice / Bentaex!

🧠 **Why two names?**  
**Bentaex** is my coding name – where I develop, design, and build tools, add-ons, and software.  
**Aice** is my gaming name – in the world of games, I’m a creative thinker and community-driven player.

🎨 I'm a passionate **hobby developer** and **UI/UX designer** from Hamburg, Germany.  
I love turning ideas into projects, designing intuitive systems, and exploring the intersection of tech and gaming.

🚀 **Founder of [GobFora](https://gobfora.de)**  
GobFora is my creative and technical project label, combining everything I work on.  
One of its key projects is **[GoblinForge]**, my add-on and modding studio for games like *World of Warcraft* and more.
