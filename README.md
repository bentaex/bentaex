![Welcome to my GitHub profile](https://github.com/2Luna/2luna/blob/main/banner.gif?raw=true)

I'm currently working on a new website for my dad's company, PC321 Ldt., because the old one needed a fresh look. I'm a self-taught UI/UX designer with a love for making things beautiful and functional. 🌸
